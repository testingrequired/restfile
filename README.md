[![restfile](https://github.com/testingrequired/restfile-ts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/testingrequired/restfile-ts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A collection of REST requests in a file format designed to be deterministic and easy to read/write.

## Goals

- Easy to read and write. Inspired by markdown.
- Writing REST request strings versus a request object
- Explicit. Variables, secrets and prompts must be declared before usage.
- Source control friendly. Diffs should be easy to understand.
- DSL as flat as possible. Less mistakes and frustrations by avoid nested structures.

## Example

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for full details around structure, prompts, and templating.

## CLI

### Installation

1. Clone down this repo. This package isn't published at this time.
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Run `npm run global-install`

### Create New Restfile

```bash
$ restfile init ./new.restfile.yml
# Fill in name, description, env names...
```

### Running A Request

```bash
$ restfile run examples/example.restfile.yml geo
# Fill In Request Prompts...
# ipaddr: 1.1.1.1
```

#### Tests

If a request has tests defined you can run those by including the `--test` or `-t` flag. It will display a diff between the test's expected response and the actual response.

```bash
$ restfile run examples/example.restfile.yml geo --test
```

The test will check the response message to the test message and report differences. It will only check headers defined in the test request. Future versions will do the same for the presence of the body.

#### Dry Run

The dry run flag (`--dry`, `-d`) will display the request but will not execute it or it's tests.

```bash
$ restfile run -e prod examples/example.restfile.yml geo --dry
```

### Repl

```bash
$ restfile repl examples/example.restfile.yml
# >
```

```bash
> await run(requests.ip);
> await run(requests.geo, {ipaddr: responseBody.ip})
> responseBody[0].country
# 'United States'
```
